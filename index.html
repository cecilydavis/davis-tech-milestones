            <!--About-->
        <p id="para1">Technology has developed so rapidly in recent years, it’s hard to choose which are most significant. Here is a small list of 5 major technology milestones between 1942 and today.</p>
            <!--Hedy Lamar-->
            <h3 class=left>1942 - Hedy Lamarr</h3>
        <p class=left>
            Hedy Lamarr was an Austrian-American actress and inventor who created the technology that would one day form the basis for today’s WiFi, GPS, and Bluetooth communication systems.She started out by creating a system intended for warfare. The system involved the use of “frequency hopping” on radio waves, with both transmitter and receiver hopping to new frequencies together. This prevented the interception of the radio waves, allowing a torpedo to find its intended target. Although she died in 2000, Lamarr was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame for the development of her frequency hopping technology in 2014. This achievement led Lamarr to be named “the mother of Wi-Fi” and other wireless communications which play one of the most significant roles in the technology we use daily. <br>

            <!--Timesharing-->
            <h3 class=right>1961 - Timesharing</h3>
        <p class=right>
            Time-sharing was a method of operation in which multiple users with different programs interact with the central processing unit of a large-scale digital computer. Many computer networks are organized for the purpose of exchanging data and resources centred on time-sharing systems. It was developed in November 1961 by Fernando Corbato. Today, we use time-sharing techniques including multiprocessing, parallel operation, and multiprogramming.

            <!--Macintosh-->
            <h3 class=left>1984 - Apple’s Macintosh</h3>
        <p class=left>
            The first Macintosh was introduced on January 24, 1984, by Steve Jobs and it was the first commercially successful personal computer to feature the mouse and the graphical user interface, rather than the normal command-line interface of its predecessors. The invention of this computer has led to much more than just the development of our laptops today. It led to the takeover of touchpads, Microsoft office, aesthetically pleasing icons,and hypercard. Although hypercard did not have a huge impact on our technology today, it inspired Tim Berners-Lee’s early collaborator Robert Cailliau, who helped in inventing the basic technologies of a HyperCard-like technology called the World Wide Web. It had two primary markets. The first was the 25 million workers who sit behind desks, and particularly those in medium and small-sized businesses. And the second market was for the 11 million college students in the U.S alone.

            <!--Windows-->
            <h3 class=right>1985 - Microsoft Windows</h3>
        <p class=right>
            The original Windows 1 was released in November 1985 and was Microsoft’s first true attempt at a graphical user interface. It was developed by Microsoft founder Bill Gates and ran on top of MS-DOS.It was notable because it relied heavily on use of a mouse before the mouse was a common computer input device. Microsoft not only put a PC in every home and on every desk but helped to define the relationships between OEMs, platform providers, developers, businesses and consumers that have led to present day personal computing. The development of this software has had one of the greatest impacts on the devices we use today, whether you use PC, Mac, or any other type of computer. Today, the latest versions of Windows are used by millions of people worldwide.

            <!--WWW-->
            <h3 class=left>1989- The World Wide Web</h3>
        <p class=left>
            British scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989 while working at CERN. The Web was originally developed to meet the demand for automated information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world. Not only has the world wide web made it possible for everyone to have access to the internet, it has kept it both affordable and neutral. We use the world wide web everyday on our laptops, smartphones, and tablets but it has definitely had the greatest impact on the US, EU, and Indian school systems by making it extremely easy and convenient to research a topic of interest.
